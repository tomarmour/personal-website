### Project Overview
This work was produced as part of a coursework assignment for a CAD module. The Bottle was modelled using NX 11 using surfacing modelling techniques. The internal fluid was then created form the internal bottle surfaces. To produce the rendered image the assembly was imported into Keyshot 8. The surfaces, textures and lighting were applied and the various images generated.
