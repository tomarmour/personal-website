### Project Overview
Within the current climate, improvements to domestic shower water usage have been highlighted as an opportunity to reduce domestic water wastage. This project focuses to reducing the water wasting in the act of using a domestic shower, primarily thought the use of stop/start technology.



A literature review was conducted to gain a knowledge of the available technology and current state-of-the-art products on the market also focused on reducing shower water usage. A full design cycle was then undertaken to develop the chosen concept into a final prototype design. This was then subjected to several testing phases to provide justification to the various design decisions taken. The testing procedure were based to various British standards to ensure the design conformed to required assessments.



The testing consisted of lab based testing to verify, flow distribution, stress tests and accelerated fatigue testing, the second component was human testing to gauge the usability of the product. Many test were conducted confirming the design was capable of conforming to the standards. Unfortunately during the first human test, the prototype failed allowing water into the electronics compartment destroying the prototype.

This project has highlighted there is a potential for a water saving of a stop start shower, that the system works in isolation but required further development to become a robust product ready for market.
