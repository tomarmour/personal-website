### University 1st year visulisation
The brief for this project was to take an everyday object and recreate it with Seimens NX10.
From the generated CAD, the NX 10 visulisation tools were used to render out the form.



### Gallery
{{< gallery album="gallery" >}}


### Animation
Below is an example of the animation processed in Keyshot 8 allowing the rendered image to be animated.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/437785954" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="vimeo video" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
 </div>
